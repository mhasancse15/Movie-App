### Structural design pattern
The app is built with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is its structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:
- Models hold application data. Theyâ€™re usually structs or simple classes.
- Views display visual elements and controls on the screen. Theyâ€™re typically subclasses of UIView.
- View models transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. Theyâ€™re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.
